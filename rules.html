            <h4> SPORTSMANSHIP</h4>
            <p>
                The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice the
                ideals
                of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or
                referee
                whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of
                technical
                hockey background, expertise, accomplishments or standing. <br> <br>
